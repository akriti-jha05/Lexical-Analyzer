# Lexical-Analyzer
A C-based implementation of a Lexical Analyzer that scans source code and converts it into meaningful tokens as part of the compiler front-end process.

### Key Features:

- Tokenizes source code into keywords, identifiers, operators, and special symbols

- Reads input source code character-by-character using file handling

- Applies character classification and string comparison for accurate token recognition

- Handles whitespace and delimiters to ensure correct token separation

- Displays recognized tokens in a clear and structured output format

### Learning Outcomes:

- Hands-on understanding of compiler design fundamentals

- Practical exposure to the lexical analysis phase

- Improved proficiency in C programming, file handling, and string manipulation
